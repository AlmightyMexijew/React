GTWebDev React build

Nav--> NavLogo + NavList
NavList --> Could be button or list link out components
NavLogo --> span with a span inside.
Body --> show contents of #about,#portfolio,#contact
-------
Other components and subcomponents possible:
Body(Home): h1 header line + statement of purpose + Date/Website thing + pic +  services list

Most needed of the 3:services list --> component ServiceList()
subcomponents --> Design(),Dev(),ProjectManage()
each with the contents of the vanilla page

Body(About): h2 section title + personal bio + Design Explanation + Dev skill explanation

Most needed component: Could be single page because it's informational.

Body(Portfolio)
h3 for title portfolio + 3 similar units of projects.
Component: project == title h3 + img + explanation + link
To start, have 3 different subcomponents based on main. Eventually change this to feed into itself from an object or array.


Body(Contact)
H3 title(contact me) + p about contacting me to work/talk/whatever + social media links.
possible components: socialmedia --> each one specific subcomponent. when we can do the feed approach of body(portfolio) then same idea could expand here where socialmedia feeds an img/icon + p about what it is for unfamiliar + link to said space.
